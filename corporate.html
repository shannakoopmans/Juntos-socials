      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>Our campaign is mostly about connecting with others and enjoying our product together. We want to encourage our target group to get to know their old or new friends even better. We have made several posts and stories on Instagram to spread our message and we have all shared the account on our own accounts to expose it to a decent amount of people. For our reach objective we wanted to reach around 1000-3000 people. Our affect objectives were for our target audience to feel a feeling of being together,having fun, making memories, a warm feeling. Our response objective was for our target audience to get to know each other by using the questions inside our labels.</p>
      <p>We have chosen Instagram as our platform as that is the platform that most students use and they use it the most as well. We believe that because of our contest and hashtag we have created on Instagram, that we will get more people to share it on Instagram and also use the questions on the labels, like our response objective.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>We set a goal in our Communication and media plan of how much traction we wanted to get on our Instagram, but we believe that we may have set this goal too high. If we maybe posted earlier and more consistently, we might have gotten closer to our goal and our vision for our campaign. What we had envisioned for the design of our Instagram page turned out the way we had in mind.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>We have created a website and a social media campaign. However if we would continue with this project, we would create more content for Instagram to build our exposure and the brand itself as well as use more social media platforms.</p>
      <p> I think what we would do differently relating the marketing assignment is using more social media platforms for our brand. We think that we would have possibly been able to create more exposure that way. We also would probably promote our current account on Instagram more to get more followers and get more people to get to know our brand.</p>
		<p>We would like to create more video content as well as encourage people to share a picture of them when they're enjoying the beer with our hashtag. We also had the idea to collaborate with other brands and apps like Amigos, which people (students) use to let others know that they have a party or want to have a drink with other people. On this app people could meet new people while enjoying our beer and answer the questions on the inside of the labels to get to know each other better.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
      <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
